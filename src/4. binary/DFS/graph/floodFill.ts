// 733. Flood Fill

// You are given an image represented by an m x n grid of integers image, where image[i][j] represents the pixel value of the image. You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color. Your task is to perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].
//
//  To perform a flood fill:
//
//  Begin with the starting pixel and change its color to color.
//  Perform the same process for each pixel that is directly adjacent (pixels that share a side with the original pixel, either horizontally or vertically) and shares the same color as the starting pixel.
//  Keep repeating this process by checking neighboring pixels of the updated pixels and modifying their color if it matches the original color of the starting pixel.
//  The process stops when there are no more adjacent pixels of the original color to update.
//  Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.

// Example 1:
// Input: image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2
// Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
// Explanation:
// From the center of the image with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1) (i.e., the red pixel), all pixels
// connected by a path of the same color as the starting pixel (i.e., the blue pixels) are colored with the new color.
// Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not horizontally or vertically connected to the starting pixel.
//
//
// Input: image = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], sr = 0, sc = 0, color = 0
// Output: [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
// Explanation:
// The starting pixel is already colored with 0, which is the same as the target color.
// Therefore, no changes are made to the image.
